# 3 Principles Of Web Design

## Simplicity & Flat design
The website only includes necessary elements to allow ease of use. Is straight to the point and clear in its functions. There is no clutter and elements have room to breathe (whitespace). To keep the site so simple I choose a flat design style. I used minimal shadows to add some depth to the navigation and enhance readability of text. A sans-serif font was used for buttons and headings to follow the theme of simplicity.

## Emphasis
The website uses emphasis to give an object more importance. For example the header is the biggest part of the page and is full of color (from the image). It is also near the top after the navigation bar. It tells the viewer what the page is about. The viewers first look usually goes to the header.

## Alignment
The Website uses alignment to associate similar or related items next to each other. For example the like button and image description relates to an image and are thus positioned in close proximity to it. The images are positioned in an invisible grid to make them separate entities.
